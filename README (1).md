•	An Automate and voice-controlled assistant for your desktop.  

## Features

- Voice recognition can provide an alternative to typing on a keyboard. 

- The user talks into an external microphone, headset or built-in microphone and their words appear as text on the screen.

- You can control your device by telling it what to do, in a step-by-step process with any element shown on the screen; those actions include “select”, “open”, “type”, “send”, “scroll”, “go back” and “go home” among other commands.

- Cross platform
